MyIRRemote
==========

This is a small project I set up for turning my Galaxy S4 into an IR remote for my TV and Xbox.

This is kinda specific for my setup for now and it's not pretty at all, but feel free to make suggestions and use my app. If you want to make changes or use my code, go ahead but attribute it to me with a link to this repo on github.

Future plans I will likely use better icons and add support for more buttons and more TV's.
